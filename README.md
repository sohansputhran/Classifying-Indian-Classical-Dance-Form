# Hackerearth Deep Learning Challenge: Identify the Dance Form

## This was my submission to the Challenge on Hackerearth in which I had to classify the Indian classical dance images into 8 different categories of classical dance form.

InceptionResNetV2 transfer learning model gave a better prediction compared to other models that I used.

## My prediction got a score of 82.65 on the test dataset and I finished the challenge at 131 rank out of 5000+ participants (top 2%)
