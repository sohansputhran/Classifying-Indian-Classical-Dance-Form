## This was my submission to the Challenge on Hackerearth in which I had to classify the indian classical dance form into 8 different categories using images.

I will upload the data on kaggle soon.

## My prediction got a score of 82.65 on the test dataset and I finished the challenge at 131 rank out of 5000+ participants (top 2%)
